1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your life is your life.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,400
Don't let it be gloved into dank submission.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,560
Beyond the watch.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,600
There are ways out.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,280
There is a light somewhere.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,840
It may not be much light, but it beats the darkness.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
Beyond the watch, the gods will offer you chances.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,800
Know them, take them.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,440
You can't beat death, but you can beat death in life sometimes.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:56,160
And the more often you learn to do it, the more light there will be.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,240
Your life is your life.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,720
Know it while you have it.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,200
You are marvelous.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:13,160
The gods wait to delight in you.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,400
If you are going to try, go all the way.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Otherwise, don't even start.

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,040
If you are going to try, go all the way.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,520
This could mean losing girlfriends.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,080
Fires, relatives, jobs, and maybe you'll mind.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,160
Go all the way.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,280
It could mean not eating for three or four days.

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,800
It could mean freezing on a path bench.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,320
It could mean jail.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,040
It could mean origin, mockery, isolation.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,920
Isolation is the gift.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
All the others are a test of your endurance.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,960
Of how much you really want to do it.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
And you do it.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,280
Despite rejection and the worst odds, and it will be better than anything else you can

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
imagine.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,880
If you are going to try, go all the way.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,360
There is no other feeling like that.

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,800
You will be alone with the gods and the nights will play in the fire.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Do it.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Do it.

36
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Do it.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Do it.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Do it.

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Do it.

40
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
All the way.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
All the way.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
All the way.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,800
You will ride mine straight to perfect laughter.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:58,880
Until you understand what life here is.
